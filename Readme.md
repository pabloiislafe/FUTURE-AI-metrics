# FUTURE-AI Metrics
*A modular and transparent framework for evaluating medical AI systems*

This repository provides a lightweight Python library implementing evaluation criteria inspired by the **FUTURE-AI Initiative**, a framework for building trustworthy, safe, and clinically reliable AI systems for healthcare.

The objective of this package is to offer a consistent, extensible, and easy-to-use set of metrics that developers, researchers, and clinicians can use to quantify different aspects of model performance and data quality across medical imaging tasks.

## Background

Medical AI systems must be assessed beyond simple accuracy numbers.  
The **FUTURE-AI framework** defines six foundational principles for trustworthy AI:

1. **Fairness** – unbiased performance across populations  
2. **Universality** – generalization across data sources  
3. **Traceability** – transparent and reproducible model behavior  
4. **Usability** – practical and interpretable outputs  
5. **Robustness** – resilience to variability and imperfections  
6. **Explainability** – clear reasoning behind predictions

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-user/FUTURE-AI-metrics.git
cd FUTURE-AI-metrics

conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate future-ai-metrics
